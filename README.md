<strong>What is a Pattern?</strong><br>

A design pattern is a commonly encountered solution to a particular problem in software architecture design.
<br>
Unlike ready-made functions or libraries, a pattern cannot simply be taken and copied into a program. A pattern is not a specific code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem, which will still need to be adjusted to the needs of your program.

<i>In short: Design patterns (or templates) describe typical ways to solve common problems in software design.</i>

In this repository, I will be studying design patterns with examples in PHP
